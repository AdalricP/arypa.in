our vision. I thought a nice lil' project I could make using the concepts I learnt in the course would be a 3D renderer. So this short blog is just going to be explaining the math behind the project <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/AdalricP/3D-Rendering-Engine\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/AdalricP/3D-Rendering-Engine\" target=\"_self\">Tesseris</a> Table of contents\n| Vanishing points &amp; the horizon line\n| Going mathematical: the Affine plane to the Projective plane\n| Homogenous Co-ordinates &amp; an analytical definition for the projective plane\n| The Perspective DivideIn a 2D space, when you look at parallel lines, they never intersect, right? Well, that changes with perspective. For example, this image of rail lines here. You see how even though they are parallel lines, they do eventually intersect at a far off point? Well, that point is known as the vanishing point and in projective geometry, all parallel lines meet at a certain vanishing point.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250818140258.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250818140258.png\" target=\"_self\">Now, the height of this vanishing point is known as the horizon line. In fact, all vanishing points in an image lie on the horizon line.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250818141808.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250818141808.png\" target=\"_self\">Let's go a bit mathematical, we first start with the ordinary plane you may have already seen in geometry, the affine plane. We'll say that the affine plane is a set or a collection, and it's elements are known as points, oh, we also have a collection of collections, subsets within the set known as lines.Now, we take for granted that these three rules are true for the affine plane, in math, these basic assumptions are called axioms out of which all truth is based. So, we have three axioms, If we have two unique points P &amp; Q, there is one and ONLY one line that contains both P and Q.\nTwo lines are parallel if they are equal (both have P &amp; Q) or if they have no points in common. If you have a line and a point there is only ONE line which is parallel to and passes through . You can pick at least THREE points which aren't in a line.This defines our affine plane. Now, to get to our projective plane, we have to add in the notion of certain \"points at infinity.\" How? Let's take a look. Let A be our affine plane, and let's take a line on our plane, is known as the pencil of lines parallel to , a pencil can mean either the set of all lines passing through a point or the set of all of the lines that are parallel to our line.You can think of the projection of this pencil as the vanishing point. , so we can define our completed projective plane as the set of all the points in + all these ideal points of . The projective plane follows axioms.\nP1 Two distinct points P, Q of S lie on one and ONLY one line.\nP2 Any two lines meet in at least one point. --&gt; This is what leads to the vanishing points\nP3 There exists at least THREE points which are not in a line\nP4 Every line contains AT LEAST three points.Now that we have defined our projective plane, our next goal is to develop an analytical definition of such. A point of can be thought of as a line through the origin. Now, we can represent this point corresponding to the line as different from the point . The numbers are the homogenous co-ordinates of . Any other point on the line can be thought of as where . And actually - both and where represent the SAME points.Let's take on one hand S, whose points are given by homogenous coordinates , on the other hand, let's take our euclidean plane with cartesian coordinates which completes to the real projective plane . So the points of are the points of + the ideal of points. Now a pencil of parallel lines is just a collection of all the parallel lines right? So since they're parallel, they must all have the same slope which we can therefore use to determine that pencil. So we can say that the ideal points are described by the coordinate .Now let's create a transformation from one hand to another, , and let be a point of , if we simply get our vanishing points with slope this makes sense because can't both be 0.now if we can define to be the point of A with the coordinates and note here, if we replace by our values for and stay the same.\nNow, we can use this to find everyone point on A, in fact, any point with coordinates is the image of the point on with homogenous coordinates . Which brings us to the main part: The perspective divide.We will extend our current definition into 3D with components, and the 4D homogeneous coordinate system with or Which gives us, Where lines through the origin in represent points in the 3D coordinate system.The division by or is known as the perspective divide in computer graphics, this is what corrects the position of objects according to the perspective, provides the vanishing point, and makes further objects appear smaller. <br>Further Reading: This was just a (very) brief overview, if you'd like to understand the math better - I'd recommend going through the first handful of pages of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/reu/lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fmedia=hartshorne_foundations_of_projective_geometry.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/reu/lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fmedia=hartshorne_foundations_of_projective_geometry.pdf\" target=\"_self\">this book by Robin Hartshorne</a> for deeper understanding<br>~<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://aryanpahwani.tech/redshift/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://aryanpahwani.tech/redshift/\" target=\"_self\">/back</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Blog","#CS","#Math"],"headers":[{"heading":"Part.1.
