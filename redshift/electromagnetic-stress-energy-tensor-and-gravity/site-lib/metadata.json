Gravity is created through Electromagnetism; Understanding Einstein's stress-energy tensor","icon":"","description":"This slightly feels sci-fi, however the claims are backed up theoretically, it's just a fun quirk of general relativity that is very interesting to observe. None of this is practically possible just yet, but maybe in the near future though ;)Throughout the blog, as is common I've used Einstein Notation, would recommend reading it up quickly <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation\" target=\"_self\">here</a> incase you care about the math here - which there is a bit of.You must've heard of Einstein's General Relativity, right? From all those pop-sci physics videos you've been stacking up? There you would've learnt about relativity in an analogy with a mass on a fabric, bending the fabric around it as such - and then you would've expanded that thinking into thinking that the mass bends space-time around it, a 3-D Fabric being bent in a 4-dimensional way.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250908150340.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20250908150340.png\" target=\"_self\"> Further, if you have ever pursued an undergraduate degree in physics, you must've learnt about general relativity - and the following equation, which describes the curvature of space-time.\nG is Newton's Gravitational Constant that you may have previously learnt about in high-school physics. (pronounced 'kah-pah') is known as the Einstein's Gravitational constant. We won't be writing that, doesn't make much of a difference anyways.For those who are not aware, here, the terms describe the curvature and shape of spacetime, very complicated and interesting stuff, but let's not go into much detail over there just yet. You may also notice a this is also pretty interesting, this defines the curvature due to empty-space, here, defines the metric tensor, which can be thought of (for simplicity, and at-least in euclidean space) as a \"unit\" of spacetime, as it defines how distance and \"time\" are measured. (remember, spacetime is one thing now, time is just another co-ordinate of space!)Here, the terms tell us how much 'distance' is gained for each co-ordinate, while the terms tell us how the co-ordinates 'mix together' and interact, think if you have a vector of length , and it's x-component is units and y-component units. If you keep it's length the same, but move the vector to a new point where it's x-component is units, clearly, the y-component would increase to units. Quite the similar thing over here! is set according to the space we're in, for what is known as the Minkowski Space, which is a flat &amp; 4D (3 Space + 1 Time dimensions) we get (Actually, all the signs can be reversed as well, (+, -, -, -) works too), this will be useful later, keep this in mind.\nThis is in the covariant form, to convert between covariant and contravariant (i.e. you can use find the matrix inverse because of the relationship for the minkowski space though, they are equal as the tensor is it's own inverse.For some vector , the metric tensor helps us convert between covariant/vector () and contravariant () forms, by and The symbol, defines the cosmological constant, fancy term, but all that it really says is that even empty-space has some energy to it. Actually, the term represents the energy-density of empty space, and is related to expansion/contraction of the universe.\nIf you want to learn more about these concepts, I'd suggest checking out the Libretext Physics pages on these, now, let's get to the juicy partLet's look at the last term that's left now.\nHere represents the stress-energy tensor. I'd argue this is one of the most important aspects of general relativity, as it is what defines how objects with energy or momentum can distort spacetime. Yes! It isn't mass that bends spacetime, but rather energy and momentum! You can check how the stress-energy tensor arises in Appendix 1Let's also write the stress-energy tensor in a matrix form, to better understand what it's made up of,Here, defines the multiplying this by gives us the Energy Density (See: ) Actually, is just Energy Density expressed in mass units, this will be important in just a bit! defines the of the momentum or amount of k-th component of momentum per unit volume. (How much is present) defines the or the or how much k-th momentum flows per unit area per unit time. (How much is moving)The other elements represent the flux-density of the k-th component across a surface perpendicular to the k-th axis, for this gives us the , while for it represents or .Which fits into our original equation,\nThis works for rest-mass, but as we just discussed, it's not just rest-mass which affects spacetime, but actually the energy and momentum. So calling the relativistic mass may be a bit confusing, since what we're actually, physically measuring is the Energy Density, for the rest of the blog, I'll be calling it the Energy Density. (This does mean that, technically speaking an electromagnetic field can also have mass, which is also a very interesting point whose consequences I may touch upon in a later 'appendix' perhaps).So, we can use our field equation for anything that affects energy and momentum, something like the Electromagnetism perhaps! Well, is the general stress-energy tensor which arises from anything that affects momentum &amp; energy, is the Electromagnetic Stress Energy tensor, which arises due to electromagnetic fields. It is written as\nCool. Fancy equation. Now what the hell does that mean?Side-note, you can check the derivation for Electromagnetism Stress-Energy tensor from Appendix 2Well, let's analyse the first term: represents the electromagnetic field tensor in covariant form, which is written as,\nI would recommend you to learn more about the electromagnetic field tensor from Chapter 12 of Introduction To Electrodynamics by GriffithsRemember Einstein Notation, from which we know for clarity, we can expand this as follows, for some and ,\nNow looking at the second term,\nSo, generally we get the equation for our tensor to be,\nGreat! With this we can find the electromagnetic stress-energy for any spacetime. However, we must first specify the type of spacetime we're using. For the sake of this blog, I'll just go with Minkowski spacetime,\nthis is a flat 4-Dimensional spacetime, with 3 space dimensions and 1 time dimension, for which we get the metric tensor in the form (+, -, -, -) or (-, + + +), let's work with the latter.\n(this is what it looks like btw)<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251005185342.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20251005185342.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAccording to convention we'll write for Minkowski Spacetime and as mentioned earlier we know (read annotation in metric tensor).This will specify our general space equation for the stress-energy to\nCool, let's start evaluating our , I'll show the first element as a sample calculation, but the rest is left as an exercise to the reader.We can write the first term as,\nTaking a look again at our Electromagnetic Field Tensor,\nand our Minkowski Metric Tensor,\nWe can see that and , so we can write\nSumming over we get,\nSimilarly, we can find for the second term, , now,\nAlright, so we can divide this sum into three parts, namely, the which is just , the time-space components, and , so,\nFor the space-space components, we get (Tensor for reference)\nLet's look at the time-space components, here because the field tensor is asymmetric we get that, and which gives us,\nTherefore the sum of the two time-space parts will be,\nWe can write this as,\nAgain, since we're using the signs (-, +, +, +) here, we get that, , and any other (note: here, we aren't working with the time-time component, where ) so we get that, which gives us,\nWe can see from the tensor the summation of terms is just so,\nDividing by we get,\nNow, we can look at the space-space component, we have, where as discussed previously, therefore,Now, we sum over, , and divide by (why divide by two? well, since summing over would count every element twice.), so we get,\nEvaluating,\nTherefore we get that,\nSo, adding all the three parts we get, (also, since we aren't working with SI units right now anyways, I'll just set &amp; for convenience, I'll bring SI units back in when we need them for proper calculations for the possible applications)\nNow going all the way back to our stress-energy tensor equation, we have the equation\nThis is known as the energy density.Therefore, we get our stress-energy tensor as,\nFor the sake of keeping this blog short, I'll let you work-out the rest of the variables (trust me, it won't take that long), for now, just take this as a blackbox truth that the Electromagnetic Stress Energy tensor(SI units) in the Minkowski spacetime looks like this,Here, are the poynting vectors and is the maxwell stress tensor, and is defined as,\nThis electromagnetic stress-energy tensor is what determines how electromagnetic fields affect the geometry of spacetime. This means a sufficiently strong electromagnetic field is capable of producing gravity. I wanted to prioritise the core theory in this blog, but of course, the interesting part obviously lies in the consequences and applications, now, in-reality the gravitational effect of electromagnetic fields is extremely weak and not really useful for any major applications just yet (but if you do have any cool ideas, please send me a mail :)), but this doesn't mean we can't explore some interesting theoretical applications of course.The first and most interesting case that would probably pop up in your mind, is that light has electromagnetic fields, does that mean light has a gravitational effect too? And the answer is *Yes!*Now, Photons aren't fermions, so they aren't subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are bosons, they can stack together. Which means we can sort of, play around, and create a blackhole with a bunch of high-energy photons. This is known as the kugelblitz.<br><img alt=\"A Matrioshka brain is an example of a Class B stellar engine, employing the entire energy output of a star to drive computer systems_.jpeg\" src=\"a-matrioshka-brain-is-an-example-of-a-class-b-stellar-engine,-employing-the-entire-energy-output-of-a-star-to-drive-computer-systems_.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">Another cool application are spinning superconductors and gravitomagnetic fields, gravitomagnetic fields are, as the name suggests, the magnetic equivalent of gravity or .\nmagnetic field : electric field :: gravitomagnetic field : gravitational field,\nin the common fabric relativity analogy this is like the mass spinning and twisting the fabric.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20251007131620.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20251007131620.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Interestingly, since superconductors would have an electromagnetic field, when they're spun around quite fast, they may produce a large gravitomagnetic effect.

That doesn't mean we can't explore some cool, albeit theoretical, concepts, or try to think of possible applications - since that's always fun to do. :)That's kind of it for the blog, I've put a few
